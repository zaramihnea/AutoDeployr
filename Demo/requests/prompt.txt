Create a single GET endpoint /estimateAll, that first calls http://host.docker.internal:8080/api/v1/zaramihnea/functions/bookmanager/get_all_books  GET 
(the expected response is 
{
  "books": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Book Title",
      "author": "Author Name"
    },
    {
      "id": 2, 
      "title": "Another Book",
      "author": "Another Author"
    }
  ]
}) 
to get all the books from a library, then calls POST http://host.docker.internal:8080/api/v1/zaramihnea/functions/bookmanager/estimate_book_price with the json body
{
  "book_id" : <<book id>>
} 
(expected JSON response 
{
  "book_title": "Book Title",
  "estimated_price": "$15-25 USD"
}) 
to estimate the price for each book that it got from the first endpoint. It should return all book titles and the price that was estimated.
